# 🎓 Bri Graduation Tribute Website

A personal web project honoring a friend’s college graduation through storytelling, design, and code.

## 📖 About the Project

This tribute site was created to celebrate Bri, a powerful and loving Haitian woman who has inspired others through her resilience, care, and light. It’s a digital thank-you and celebration of her graduation journey — and a reflection of how code can be used to uplift people and communities.

While deeply personal, this project also highlights my belief in building with empathy, designing with purpose, and telling meaningful stories through web experiences.

## 🌍 Project Goals

- Celebrate identity, perseverance, and community.
- Use HTML and CSS to build a beautiful, responsive tribute site.
- Experiment with using code to honor real-world experiences and stories.
- Reflect my own values as a developer who cares about people, not just products.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- HTML5  
- CSS3  
- Responsive Design  
- Git & GitHub Pages

## 📸 Key Features

- Custom visuals and styling tailored to Bri’s energy and femininity
- Written tribute capturing personal memories and community impact
- Responsive layout designed to look good across devices

## 🙌 Why It Matters

This site isn’t just about one person — it’s about representation. It’s about celebrating the impact of Black women, especially Haitian women, who rise through adversity and uplift others along the way. 

By building this, I wanted to honor someone close to me while also reflecting the kind of developer I’m becoming: one who builds with heart, intention, and impact.
